## GETTING STARTED WITH PHP
[PHP](https://www.php.net/) (Hypertext Pre-processor) is a web server-side programming language. It enables developers to build web applications that interact with databases.

### Why PHP?
PHP can be used to do many things. Let us look at some of the reasons why PHP is used:
1. PHP is platform-independent. Therefore it can run on major operating systems. ie. Mac OS, Windows, or Linux.
2. It can run on all modern servers eg. Apache
3. PHP can be integrated with databases like [MariaDb](https://mariadb.org/).
4. It is easy to learn and put in place.
5. PHP frameworks are used by web developers to build web apps more efficiently. Here are some of the most popular PHP frameworks:

   1. [Yii 2](https://www.yiiframework.com/) -- A generic PHP framework used for developing web applications with many ties.
   2. [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) --  A PHP framework designed for making web apps easier and faster for developers.
   3. [FuelPHP](https://fuelphp.com/) -- A PHP framework that supports data-oriented web applications

### Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, make sure you have Xampp. You can download Xampp [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). **In this article, we will be using Ubuntu**. A folder `/opt/lampp` will be created after your done with the installation.

After installation, you **must start** Xampp by running the following command:
```bash
$ sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start

Starting XAMPP for Linux 7.4.10-0...
XAMPP: Starting Apache...ok.
XAMPP: Starting MySQL...ok.
XAMPP: Starting ProFTPD...ok.
```

### Creating the PHP files
Navigate to `/opt/lampp/htdocs` and create a new folder `hello` where we will have our PHP files. Open a terminal and run the command below.

```bash
$ cd /opt/lampp/htdocs
$ sudo mkdir hello
$ cd hello
```

Then, create a new file `index.php` in `/opt/lampp/htdocs/hello` using this command.

```bash
$ sudo touch index.php
```

Then, open the file using [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) by running the following command.

```bash
$ sudo gedit index.php
```

### A hello world program
We are going to write a simple PHP program. Let's look at the basic syntax of a PHP program. PHP code is written between `<?php>` and `?>` tags in a PHP files.

```php
<?php
//php code is written here
?>
```

In the `index.php` file you created above put the following code and save:

```php
<?php
 echo "<h1>Hello world!</h1>";
?>
```

We use the `echo` statement to display output on the screen. In the code above, we use the `echo` statement to display a Html heading.

To run this code, open your browser at http://localhost/hello. Here, we append the folder name .ie `hello` to the base URL http://localhost/.

You should see something like this image on your browser:

![php](helloworld.png)

Congratulations! You have written your first PHP program.

### Variables in PHP
Variables are containers used for holding data types. When writing variables always make sure it starts with a letter or an underscore but not a number.

In PHP, variables are created by writing the dollar($) sign followed by the variable name. Let us look at a simple example.

```php
<?php
$txt = "how old are you?";
$x = 25;
$y = 67;
?>
```
In this code, `txt` is a variable holding a string `how old are you?`, variable `$x` holds the number `25`, and variable `$y` holds the number `67`.

### Conditional statements in PHP
Conditional statements are used to perform some actions if a certain condition is adhered to. They include :

- `if` statement - used to execute some code if a given condition is `True`.
- `if... else` statement -  the `if` block is used to execute some code if a certain condition is true. If the condition is false, then the `else` block executes another block of code.
This statement executes some code based on the true or false state of the condition.
- `if... else if...else` statement - It is like the `if ...else` statement, but with the ability to check for many conditions.

Let us put in place each of the statement above:

### 1. The if statement
Below is a syntax for an `if` statement.
```php
if(condition){
 //code to execute
}
```
Let us look at an example.
```php
<?php
$age = 15;

if ($age < 18) {
 echo "a kid!";
}
?>
```
Running this code gives `"a kid!"` as the output.
### 2. The if...else statement
The syntax of an if else block looks like this:
```php
if(condition){
 //code to execute if condition is true
}
else{
 //code to execute if condition is false
}
```
A simple implementation of the above would look like this:
```php
<?php
$age = 18;
if($age < 18){
 echo "a kid!";
}
else{
 echo "so youth!";
}
?>
```
The output should be: `"so youth!"`. This is because the variable `age` is not less than 18. If we assign a value like 17 to variable `age` the output should be `"a kid!"`

### 3. if...elseif...else statement
The syntax of this statement looks as shown below.

```php
if (condition) {
 // code to execute if condition is true;
} elseif (condition_2) {
 // code to execute if condition_2 is true
} else {
 // code to execute if none of the above are true
}
```

Implementing the above in a program would look like like this:

```php
<?php
$age = "18";

if($age < "18"){
 echo "a kid!";
}
elseif($age > "35"){
 echo "a parent?";
}
else{}
 echo"a youth!";
?>
```
Since the variable `age` is equal to `18` the output of the code above should be: `"a youth!"`.

### Comments In PHP
Commenting in PHP may be done for many reasons. For example, it can a person reading the code to understand it. A commented line is not executed as a part of the program. There are 2 types of comments.

### 1. Single line comments
This is a comment spanning a single line. Look at the example below.

```php
<?php
 // this is an example of a single-line comment.
 echo"The output is:";
 # this is another one.
?>
```
As shown above, you can use 2 backslashes (`//`) or a hashtag (`#`) for single line comments.

### 2. Multi-line or block comment
This is a comment spanning many lines. Here, you can use the symbols `/*` to open and `*/` to close the comment as shown below.
```php
<?php
 echo "hello!!"
 /*
  This is a comment,
  that should span many lines
  */
?>
```
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have looked at the following:
- Basic PHP program syntax
- Variables in PHP
- Conditional statements
- Comments in PHP

Have a good `PHP` coding ahead
